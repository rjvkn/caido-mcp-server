# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **WebSocket history (read)** - exposes the WebSocket tab via raw GraphQL (the Go SDK v0.5.0 does not wrap stream queries):
  - `caido_list_ws_streams` - list WebSocket streams (connections), filterable by scope
  - `caido_list_ws_messages` - list frames of a stream with direction (CLIENT/SERVER), format (TEXT/BINARY), and decoded body (base64 `Blob` decoded, truncated to `body_limit`)
- **`caido_convert_body`** - convert a request body between JSON, form-urlencoded, XML, and multipart/form-data. Pure stdlib; flat objects are lossless, nested JSON uses bracket notation (`a[b]=c`).
- **`caido_race_window_send`** - fire multiple raw HTTP/1.1 requests with a synchronized last-byte send (single-packet / race-window style) for race-condition testing. Dials targets directly with raw sockets and parks all connections at a barrier before writing final bytes. NOTE: bypasses the Caido proxy, so these requests do not appear in Caido history.

### Changed
- Tool count 62 -> 64.

### CI
- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) - on a `v*` tag push, cross-compiles both binaries for 6 platforms via `scripts/build.sh`, generates `sha256sums.txt`, and publishes a GitHub Release with assets named to match `install.sh`.

### Tests
- Test coverage for the `internal/tools` package raised from ~23% to ~70%: new table-driven suites for Findings, Intercept, Workflows, Tamper, Projects/Scopes, Environments/Filters, Replay collections, Automate/Tasks, misc reads, and WebSocket tools. New `internal/httputil/bodyconvert` (92.9%) and `internal/raceattack` (88.0%) suites.

### Internal
- Documented the genqlient v0.8.1 oneof/omitempty limitation in `create_tamper_rule.go` as an upstream constraint (the `delete_findings`/`export_findings` tools use clean typed structs and need no workaround).

### Changed (SDK alignment)
- Added WebSocket/stream read queries to `caido-community/sdk-go` (new `StreamSDK`: `List`, `Get`, `ListWsMessages`) and bumped this server to that SDK build. `caido_list_ws_streams` and `caido_list_ws_messages` now use the typed SDK wrappers instead of hand-rolled raw GraphQL.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **`caido_edit_request` MCP tool** - modify an existing request (method, path, headers, body) while preserving all auth cookies and session state, then send it. The most-requested feature for AI-driven pentesting.
- **`caido_export_curl` MCP tool** - convert any request to a ready-to-use curl command for PoC reports.
- **Replay Collections** - full CRUD:
  - `caido_list_replay_collections` - list all collections
  - `caido_create_replay_collection` - create a named collection
  - `caido_rename_replay_collection` - rename a collection
  - `caido_delete_replay_collection` - delete a collection
- **`caido_delete_replay_sessions`** - bulk delete replay sessions by ID
- **`caido_move_replay_session`** - move a session between collections
- **Scope management** - full lifecycle:
  - `caido_rename_scope` - rename a scope
  - `caido_delete_scope` - delete a scope
- **Project management** - full CRUD:
  - `caido_create_project` - create a new project
  - `caido_rename_project` - rename a project
  - `caido_delete_project` - delete a project
- **Environment management**:
  - `caido_create_environment` - create a new environment
  - `caido_delete_environment` - delete an environment
- **Filter presets**:
  - `caido_create_filter` - save an HTTPQL query as a named preset
  - `caido_delete_filter` - delete a filter preset
- **Install script auto-version** - `install.sh` now auto-detects the latest release via GitHub API (fixes #19, #20)

### Changed
- Tool count: 42 -> 60 (18 new tools)
- Full CRUD coverage across all Caido resources (scopes, projects, environments, filters, replay collections)
- Every Caido SDK operation is now exposed as an MCP tool

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **`caido_create_replay_session` MCP tool** - create named replay sessions with optional request seeding and collection assignment. Two-step flow: CreateSession then RenameSession.
- **MCP Resources** - expose Caido data as read-only resources for zero-tool-call context:
  - `caido://requests/{id}` - full request/response content
  - `caido://replay-sessions/{id}` - session details with entry list
  - `caido://sitemap` - root domains from sitemap
  - `caido://findings` - security finding summaries
- **Response fingerprinting** - responses include content kind (json/html/xml/text/binary) and content-type detection
- **Adaptive body limits** - auto-scale response body limits by content type (4KB JSON, 3KB HTML, 200B binary) when no explicit limit set
- **Response diff mode** - repeated identical responses in the same session return a compact diff summary instead of full body, saving agent tokens
- **`caido_list_hosted_files` MCP tool** - list hosted files for payload serving
- **`caido_list_tasks` MCP tool** - list running background tasks
- **`caido_cancel_task` MCP tool** - cancel a running task by ID
- **`caido_list_plugins` MCP tool** - list installed plugin packages
- **`caido_update_tamper_rule` MCP tool** - update an existing Match & Replace rule without deleting and recreating it
- **Windows binaries** - build pipeline now produces windows/amd64 and windows/arm64 .exe binaries
- **Test infrastructure** - 115 tests with race detection, mock GraphQL server, MCP in-memory transport testing, schema contract tests, GitHub Actions CI

### Changed
- Upgraded to sdk-go v0.5.0 (Caido 0.56 Query union types, HTTPQL/StreamQL split)
- Tool count: 37 -> 42 (5 new tools)
- Build targets: 8 -> 12 binaries (added Windows amd64/arm64)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **`caido_batch_send` MCP tool** - send multiple HTTP requests in parallel via session pool. Supports BAC token sweeps, parameter fuzzing, endpoint sweeps. Max 50 requests per batch, configurable concurrency (default 5, max 20). One tool call replaces N sequential `caido_send_request` calls.
- **`caido batch` CLI subcommand** - parallel HTTP through Caido Replay API. Four modes: `sweep` (same endpoint, N tokens), `fuzz` (same endpoint, N values), `ep` (N URLs, same auth), `file` (JSON batch spec). Drop-in replacement for `burp-batch` with identical interface.
- **Session pool** (`internal/replay/pool.go`) - manages N replay sessions for concurrent sends. Pre-creates sessions in parallel, acquire/release pattern with channel-based semaphore.
- **Batch engine** (`internal/replay/batch.go`) - shared by MCP tool and CLI. Handles session acquisition, CRLF normalization, host resolution, parallel polling.
- Auth mode support in CLI batch: `bearer` (default), `cookie:NAME`, `header:NAME` - matches `burp-batch` interface.

### Changed
- Upgraded sdk-go to v0.4.0 (`use_struct_references: false`) -- fixes 53 NON_NULL fields across generated types, removes manual GraphQL workarounds for `delete_findings`, `export_findings`, and `create_tamper_rule`.

### Fixed
- `caido_create_tamper_rule` -- nested oneof serialization for section, operation, matcher, and replacer fields now correct at all 4 levels of nesting.
- `caido_create_tamper_rule` -- `sources` field sent as `[]` (empty array) instead of omitted -- Caido API requires non-null.
- `caido_get_sitemap` -- null entries in sitemap response no longer cause a panic.
- `caido_run_workflow` -- Blob-encoded workflow output decoded correctly.
- `caido_list_environments` -- description field populated correctly.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- Removed WebSocket endpoint workaround (fixed upstream in sdk-go)
- README rewritten with PAT auth as recommended setup, security section added

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- `send_request` returns response inline (status code, headers, body) - no extra tool calls needed
- Response body polling with 10s timeout and fallback to `get_replay_entry`
- `get_replay_entry` now supports `bodyLimit` and `bodyOffset` parameters
- Token auto-refresh mid-session via callback (no more expired token failures)
- Replay session reuse - single session per server lifetime with automatic fallback
- IPv6 host support (`[::1]:8080`)

### Changed

- `get_replay_entry` defaults to 2KB body limit (matching `get_request`)
- `ParsedHTTPMessage` and `parseHTTPMessage` extracted to shared `http_utils.go`

### Removed
- Unused `urlEncode` function from send_request
